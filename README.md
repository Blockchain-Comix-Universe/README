Basically it's this: modern digital comix are a fail: pushing creative control into a technical barrier against entry. That's not very AI. 
Video Games of the present fail to give us the thin veil between reality and illusion which the analog comic book provided. Why? It's too real.
Meanwhile, 8 billion people are in need of a lower barrier to entry than ever before. The time of exclusive art clubs is over.
Given the large volume of quality artworks being created by AI in the programmed format of 512 pixels X 512 pixels
and utilizing the Chat GPT to explore .py and .html architechture
create scrollable image containers, assembled as composites that are easily constructed and navigated
for narrative/creative discovery,
customized peer-to-peer communication exchange,
making digital zines and 
making the real digital comix.
Because video games lack a bleeding edge in design, and I am a Marketplace Anarchist, we must demonstrate with ROI and goosepimples.
Using Adobe InDesign (or similar) do a comix composite BUILD of your AI jpgs in a frame 512 X 5120 to upload into the BCU framework, 
BUILD more complex arrangements still. Load it into the BCU framework. It's a simple 12 lines of code, img src= <<path to your art/storytelling>>
WE BUILD THE BEST DIGITAL COMIX WE CAN
and then we MAKE IT BETTER. And never stop.
